A model which predicts the chance of getting in an university based on a few parameters

Dataset taken from [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions)

The [**Classification Model**](https://github.com/vk0812/University-Admission-Predictor/blob/master/Admissions_Predictor_Classification.ipynb) predicts whether you will get admission or not

The [**Regression Model**](https://github.com/vk0812/University-Admission-Predictor/blob/master/Admissions_Predictor_Regression.ipynb) predicts the chance of getting in and based on that categorizes it to be Safe, Ambitious, Impossible:
- Safe (`more than 75%` chance of getting in)
- Ambitious (chance of getting in `between 40% and 75%`)
- Impossible (chance of getting in `less than 40%`)
